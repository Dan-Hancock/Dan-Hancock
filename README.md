- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dan-Hancock
- I am a physics graduate student who is looking to start a career in data science. While I finish my MS on a project involving designing a system that utilizes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to be deployed in-situ to monitor environmental conditions in water, and then doing in depth time series analysis and machine learning on the data to look for trends, comparisons, and predictions in order to distinguish different materials in the water. I am using my free time to learn about machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and AWS services to prepare for my career.
- My professional work can be found at (1):https://github.com/ARTS-Laboratory/In-Situ-Water-Quality-Sensor, (2):https://github.com/ARTS-Laboratory/UAV-Deployable-Stage-Height-Sensor, and (3) https://github.com/ARTS-Laboratory/Compact-NMR
