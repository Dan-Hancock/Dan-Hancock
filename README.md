- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dan-Hancock
- I am a physics graduate student who is looking to start a career in data science. While I finish my M.S. on a project involving designing a system that utilizes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to be deployed in-situ to monitor environmental conditions in water, I am using my free time to learn about machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and AWS services to prepare for my career.
